# ðŸ“° Text Classification with SVM & String Kernels  

This project was developed as part of the **[Introduction to Data Science](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/itds)** course. It focuses on **classifying news articles** using **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** with different kernel functions.  

ðŸ“„ **Original Paper:** All of the work in the project was inspired by the paper [Text Classification Using String Kernels](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/258968/1/String_JMLR02.pdf). The aim of the project was to reproduce the results, and attempt to improve them.

ðŸ“Š **Dataset:** The dataset used in the project was the [Reuters-21578](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html)
